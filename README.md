# 2D FEM heat trasmission
This project was led by the book *Fundamentals of Finite Element Analysis: Linear Finite Element Analysis* of Prof. Ioannis Koutromanos.  

In the file *Documentation.pptx* are described the main steps regarding the project implementation:
- Physical model
- From the strong to the weak form
- Implementation of the 2D FEM algorithm with triangle elements
- Execution of the order-of-accuracy test through the MMS method
- Control and simulations
